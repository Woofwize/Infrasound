    * **Eyeball Resonance:** Infrasound around 19 Hz can cause the eyeballs to resonate, leading to visual disturbances such as blurred vision or phantom images.

- **2-3 Hz (High Intensity): Motor and Cognitive Impairment**
    * **Motor Ataxia:** Frequencies in the 2-3 Hz range at high sound pressure levels (SPLs) can impair motor coordination and balance.
    * **Cognitive Impairment:** Exposure to these frequencies can also affect cognitive function, potentially causing confusion and difficulty concentrating.

- **General High-Intensity Infrasound: Broad Spectrum Effects**
    * **Pressure and Discomfort:** High-intensity infrasound can cause a sensation of pressure, discomfort, and fatigue.
    * **Psychological Distress:** Prolonged exposure may lead to psychological effects such as anxiety, stress, and irritability.

### The Importance of Intensity, Duration, and Individual Variability

The effects of infrasound on humans depend on several factors:

- **Intensity:** Higher sound pressure levels are more likely to cause adverse effects.
- **Duration of Exposure:** Longer exposure times can increase the risk of negative health outcomes.
- **Individual Variability:** Sensitivity to infrasound varies among individuals, with some people being more susceptible to its effects than others.

### Ongoing Research and Uncertainties

Research on the effects of infrasound is ongoing, and several uncertainties remain:

- **Mechanisms of Action:** The precise mechanisms by which infrasound affects the human body are not fully understood.
- **Long-Term Effects:** The long-term health effects of chronic infrasound exposure require further investigation.
- **Threshold Levels:** Determining safe exposure thresholds is crucial for developing guidelines and regulations.

## Awareness Campaigns

### Why Public Awareness is Essential for Infrasound Technology

Raising public awareness about infrasound technology is critical for several reasons:

- **Informed Decision-Making:** Empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their exposure to infrasound.
- **Public Health and Safety:** Ensuring that the public is aware of potential health risks
